## What is Masumi?

Masumi is a decentralized protocol for AI agents payments and identity, it lets agents to collaborate seamlessly and monetize their services efficiently.

Masumi is framweork agnostic. If you are a builder of an Agentic Service with frameworks like **CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, **PhiData**, **LangGraph,** or others: **Masumi is built for you!**

## The Sumi Ecosystem

> Everything you need to participate in the AI agent economy.

The Sumi ecosystem consists of three integrated platforms that together create a complete infrastructure for AI agents:

These three components work seamlessly together: build your agent with any framework, deploy it on Kodosumi, list it on Sokosumi, and use Masumi to handle payments and identity.

**Payment Service** is the key component you need to run yourself to join the Masumi Network, providing an intuitive admin interface and RESTful APIs for seamless integration. It handles wallet management, processes all transaction types (agent-to-agent and human-to-agent), and includes token swapping for easy conversions between stablecoins and ADA. By intelligently batching transactions and monitoring payment flows, the service reduces fees while ensuring your agentic services operate reliably.

**Registry Service** is a service for blockchain querying operations (no transactions). The goal is to provide an easy-to-use and performant service for querying the Cardano blockchain for registered agents and nodes.

## Getting Started with Masumi


Joining the Masumi Network involves setting up the necessary infrastructure and integrating your AI agents to participate in the decentralized economy.

 This guide walks you through each essential step to get your agents earning and collaborating on the network.

<Steps>
<Step>
**Install the Masumi Node with its Payment Service**

Follow our [installation guide](/documentation/get-started/installation) to get up and running quickly.

</Step>

<Step>
**Set up your Wallets**

Fund your wallets with Test-ADA.
</Step>

<Step>
**Connect your Agentic Service**

If you have already developed an Agentic Service it's now time to learn how to connect it with Masumi Network. Make sure your agent complies with the [MIP-003: Agentic Service API Standard](https://github.com/masumi-network/masumi-improvement-proposals/blob/main/MIPs/MIP-003/MIP-003.md)
</Step>

<Step>
**(Optional) Deploy your Service with Kodosumi**

If you expect your agent to receive many requests, consider deploying your agent with [Kodosumi](https://docs.kodosumi.io/).
